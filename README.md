## Introduction

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in various domains, and this project aims to leverage its capabilities to solve a specific problem. The purpose of this README file is to provide an overview of the project, explain how to install and use the code, discuss the dataset used, describe the model architecture, and present the results obtained.

## Project Description

The ML project presented in this repository addresses a specific problem or objective. Provide a brief description of the problem you are trying to solve or the goal you are aiming to achieve. Explain the significance of the problem and how your approach can contribute to solving it.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. Follow these steps to install the necessary packages:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/nimalan-parameshwaran/ML-PROJECT.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ML-PROJECT`.
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended): `python3 -m venv env`.
4. Activate the virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`.
5. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Explain how to use the code in the Jupyter Notebook provided. Describe the different sections or cells in the notebook and provide instructions on how to execute them. Include any additional information or dependencies that users need to know to run the code successfully.

## Data

Describe the dataset used in the project. Include details such as the source of the data, its format, and any preprocessing steps performed on it. If the dataset is publicly available, provide a link to where it can be accessed. Mention any limitations or challenges associated with the dataset.

## Model Architecture

Explain the architecture of the machine learning model employed in this project. Provide a high-level overview of the model's structure and the purpose of each component. Include any relevant equations or algorithms used. If you have visual representations of the model architecture, you can include them here.

## Training

Describe the training process of the model. Include details such as the optimizer used, the loss function employed, the number of epochs trained, and any other relevant training parameters. Explain any data augmentation techniques or regularization methods applied during training.

## Evaluation

Explain how the model's performance was evaluated. Describe the metrics used to assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, or any other relevant evaluation measures. If there are specific test sets or validation techniques used, provide details about them.

## Results

Present the results obtained from the project. Include any visualizations, tables, or graphs that demonstrate the performance of the model. Discuss the implications of the results and their significance in addressing the problem or achieving the project's objective.

## Conclusion

Summarize the key findings and outcomes of the project. Discuss any limitations or challenges encountered during the development and training of the model. Suggest potential areas for improvement or future work.
